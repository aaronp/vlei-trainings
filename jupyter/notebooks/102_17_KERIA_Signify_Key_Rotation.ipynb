    "## Introduction to Key Rotation with Signify-ts\n",
    "Key rotation is a fundamental security practice in KERI. It involves changing the cryptographic keys associated with an AID while preserving the identifier itself. This allows an identity to remain stable and persistent over time, even as its underlying keys are updated for security reasons (e.g., to mitigate key compromise or to upgrade cryptographic algorithms).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the KERIA/Signify architecture, the client (your application using Signify-ts) initiates and signs the rotation event. The KERIA agent then handles the dissemination of this event to witnesses and makes it available to other observers. This notebook illustrates the end-to-end process, showing how a rotation is performed by one client and observed by another."

    "<b>📝 SUMMARY</b><hr>\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated the key rotation process for a single-signature AID using Signify-ts:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><b>Initiation:</b> The controller of an AID (<code>clientA</code>) uses <code>client.identifiers().rotate()</code> to create and sign a rotation (<code>rot</code>) event. This is an asynchronous operation that is tracked by the KERIA agent.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Local Verification:</b> After the rotation operation completes, the controller's local key state is immediately updated. This is confirmed by observing an incremented sequence number (<code>s</code>), a new set of current keys (<code>k</code>), and a new pre-rotation commitment for the next keys (<code>n</code>).</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Remote Synchronization:</b> A remote observer (<code>clientB</code>) does not automatically see the rotation. They must explicitly query for the latest key state using <code>client.keyStates().query()</code>. This action prompts their KERIA agent to check the AID's witnesses for new events.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Consistency:</b> After a successful query, the remote observer's local KEL is updated, and their view of the AID's key state becomes consistent with the controller's view.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "This process validates KERI's core principles of forward security (old keys are retired) and distributed consistency, ensuring all parties can maintain a synchronized and verifiable view of an identity's evolution.\n",
