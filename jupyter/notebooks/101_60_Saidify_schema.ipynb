    "## Role of Schema SAIDs\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of KERI and ACDCs is the use of SAIDs (Self-Addressing Identifiers) for schemas. The SAID in a schema's `$id` field is a digest of the canonical form of that schema block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters:\n",
    "- **Lookup:** SAIDs provide a universal, unique identifier to retrieve a specific, verified version of a schema.\n",
    "- **Immutability:** Once a schema version is SAIDified and published, it's cryptographically locked. New versions require a new SAID.\n",
    "- **Integrity:** If anyone modifies the schema file after its SAID has been calculated and embedded, the SAID will no longer match the content, making tampering evident.\n",
    "      \n",
    "Calculating and embedding these SAIDs requires a specific process, often called **\"SAIDifying\"**. This involves calculating the SAIDs for the innermost blocks (like attributes, edges, rules) first, embedding them, and then calculating the SAID for the next level up, until the top-level schema SAID is computed."

But review the file **[sample_credential_schema.json](config/schemas/sample_schema.bak.json)**, since it is the schema you will use, initially unprocessed. Notice the `$id` fields are initially empty strings `\"\"`.  \n",

    "    The KERI command-line tool (`kli`) provides the <code>kli saidify</code> command. When used like <code>kli saidify --file &lt;filename&gt; --label '&lt;label&gt;'</code>, it calculates a SAID for the specified file content and can embed it into the field matching the label (e.g., <code>\"$id\"</code> at the top level).\n",

    "- Simple Web Server: Host the SAIDified JSON file on a basic web server. Controllers can be configured (often via OOBIs, covered later) to fetch the schema from that URL using its SAID. ¬† \n",
    "- Content-Addressable Network: Store the schema on a network like IPFS, where the SAID naturally aligns with the content digest used for retrieval.\n",
    "- Direct Exchange: For specific interactions, the schema could potentially be exchanged directly between parties (though less common for widely used schemas).\n",

    "    KERI uses Self-Addressing Identifiers (SAIDs) as unique, verifiable identifiers for ACDC schemas, embedded in the <code>&#36;id</code> field. A schema's SAID is a cryptographic digest of its content, guaranteeing integrity (tamper-evidence) and immutability (specific to that version). This process, called \"SAIDifying,\" involves calculating and embedding SAIDs recursively from inner blocks outwards. Practically, tools or scripts (like the example <code>process_schema_file</code> or <code>kli saidify</code>) are used to populate the initially empty <code>&#36;id</code> fields in the schema JSON. Once SAIDified, the schema must be accessible (e.g., hosted on a server) so others can retrieve and verify it using its SAID.\n",
