    "\n",
    "A key feature of KERI and ACDCs is the use of SAIDs (Self-Addressing Identifiers) for schemas. The SAID in a schema's `$id` field is a hash of the canonical form of that schema block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters:\n",
    "- **Lookup:** SAIDs provide a universal, unique identifier to retrieve a specific, verified version of a schema.\n",
    "- **Immutability:** Once a schema version is SAIDified and published, it's cryptographically locked. New versions require a new SAID.\n",
    "- **Integrity:** If anyone modifies the schema file after its SAID has been calculated and embedded, the SAID will no longer match the content, making tampering evident.\n",
    "      \n",
    "Calculating and embedding these SAIDs requires a specific process, often called **\"SAIDifying\"**. This involves calculating the SAIDs for the innermost blocks (like attributes, edges, rules) first, embedding them, and then calculating the SAID for the next level up, until the top-level schema SAID is computed."

    "    The KERI command-line tool (`kli`) provides the <code>kli saidify</code> command. When used like <code>kli saidify --file &lt;filename&gt; --label '&lt;label&gt;'</code>, it calculates a SAID for the specified file content and can embed it into the field matching the label (e.g., <code>\"$id\"</code> at the top level).\n",

    "- Simple Web Server: Host the SAIDified JSON file on a basic web server (like the vLEI-server mentioned in the tutorial ). Controllers can be configured (often via OOBIs, covered later) to fetch the schema from that URL using its SAID.   \n",
    "- Content-Addressable Network: Store the schema on a network like IPFS, where the SAID naturally aligns with the content hash used for retrieval.\n",
    "- Direct Exchange: For specific interactions, the schema could potentially be exchanged directly between parties (though less common for widely used schemas).\n",
    "The key point is that the schema, identified by its SAID, must be retrievable by parties needing to issue or verify credentials based on it.\n",

    "  <b>📝 SUMMARY</b><hr>\n",
    "    KERI uses Self-Addressing Identifiers (SAIDs) as unique, verifiable identifiers for ACDC schemas, embedded in the <code>id</code> field. A schema's SAID is a cryptographic hash of its content, guaranteeing integrity (tamper-evidence) and immutability (specific to that version). This process, called \"SAIDifying,\" involves calculating and embedding SAIDs recursively from inner blocks outwards. Practically, tools or scripts (like the example <code>process_schema_file</code> or <code>kli saidify</code>) are used to populate the initially empty $id fields in the schema JSON. Once SAIDified, the schema must be accessible (e.g., hosted on a server) so others can retrieve and verify it using its SAID.\n",
