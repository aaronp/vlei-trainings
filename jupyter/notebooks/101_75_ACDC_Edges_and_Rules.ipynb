    "## Understanding Edges and Rules\n",
    " \n",
    "Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs) are not always standalone credentials. One of their features is the ability to be cryptographically linked to other ACDCs forming verifiable chains of information. These links, or chains, are defined in the `e` (edges) section of an ACDC's payload.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ACDC Edges Section\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"edge\" is used because a chain of ACDCs is a graph data structure, specifically a directed acyclic graph, a DAG. In a graph there are nodes and edges and parent nodes are pointed to by child nodes. A child is any node that points to another node. A parent is a node that is pointed to by at least one other node. ACDCs in a chain are the nodes and the edges are references included within an ACDC that point to another ACDC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below shows the following set of credentials and their edges:\n",
    "- ACDC A is issued by identifier One to Two and has no edges.\n",
    "- ACDC B is issued by identifier Two to Three and has an edge pointing to the A credential.\n",
    "- ACDC C is issued by identifier Three to Four and has an edge pointing to the B credential.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ACDC Edge Diagram](./images/acdc-graph-edges.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see edges allow the chaining of credentials to previously issued credentials which allows a verifier to traverse the entire chain of credentials and perform cryptographic verifications and business logic validations on each link in the chain as well as the entire chain at once. This sort of credential stacking allows advanced issuance and verification workflows that can work across trust boundaries and across legal jurisdictions.\n",
    "Credential chaining in this way is one of the **most powerful** features of the KERI and ACDC protocol stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on this power, edge operators enable different kinds of credential chains, or subchains to be created for a variety of purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown above, edges allow an ACDC to point to one or more ACDCs establishing a verifiable relationship between them. Edges define the kind of relationship between a child and a parent ACDC. This relationship is expressed as an **Edge Operators** which dictates the rules between the issuer and issuee of the connected ACDCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these operators is crucial for designing ACDC ecosystems that model real-world authority, delegation, and contextual relationships. In this notebook we will focus on three unary edge operators and when to use each:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **I2I (Issuer-To-Issuee)** - the default; issuer of child ACDC is issuee of parent ACDC.\n",
    "* **NI2I (Not-Issuer-To-Issuee)** - useful for untargeted ACDCs; issuer has no relationship to parent credential issuee.\n",
    "* **DI2I (Delegated-Issuer-To-Issuee)** - issuer of child ACDC may be issuee or KEL delegate of issuee of parent ACDC.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore what each operator signifies and provide scenarios to illustrate their practical application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge operators provide the logic for validating the link between two ACDCs. They answer questions like: \"Does the issuer of this ACDC need to be the subject of the ACDC it's pointing to?\" or \"Can the issuer be someone delegated by the subject of the linked ACDC?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### ACDC Rules Section\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond these structural links, ACDCs also feature a dedicated `r` (rules) section. This section allows for the embedding of machine-readable logic, conditions, or even legal prose directly within the credential. While edges define how ACDCs are connected, rules can define additional constraints or behaviors associated with the ACDC itself or its relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules section is currently somewhat simple and mostly used for specification of legal prose declaring the terms of use for a credential. The rest of this training explores the use of edge operators."

As shown in the diagram below, this operator means that the *issuer* of a *child* credential MUST be referenced as the *issuee* of the *parent* credential. This is a **strict** constraint.\n",

    "<li><b>I2I (Issuer-To-Issuee):</b> Use when the current ACDC's issuer's authority stems directly from being the subject (issuee) of the linked ACDC. Signifies direct authority. Example: A manager (issuee of \"Manager\" ACDC) issues project access.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>NI2I (Not-Issuer-To-Issuee):</b> Use for referencing contextual or supporting ACDCs where the current issuer's authority doesn't derive from being the subject of the linked ACDC. Example: An \"Employee Skill\" ACDC linking to an external \"Training Certificate\" ACDC.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>DI2I (Delegated-Issuer-To-Issuee):</b> Use when the current ACDC's issuer is either the subject of the linked ACDC or a formally recognized delegate of that subject. Allows for flexible, multi-step delegation. Example: A QC Supervisor (delegate of Plant GM) issues a \"Batch Approved\" ACDC pointing to the GM's \"Plant Authority\" ACDC.</li>\n",
