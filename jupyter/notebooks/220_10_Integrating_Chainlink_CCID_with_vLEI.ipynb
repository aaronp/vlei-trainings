    "- **Manage your Policies Dynamically**: Update policy rules in real-time without changing your core business applications using ACE’s Policy Manager\n",
    "- **Protect Privacy**: Keep sensitive information secure off-chain while still executing identity-based checks and rules  on-chain\n",
    "- **Connect Everything**: Link existing vLEI infrastructure to any blockchain application\n",

    "### Your Credentials, Extended\n",
    "If your organization already has vLEI credentials, you've invested in establishing a verified, trusted digital identity. Chainlink ACE extends this investment by making your credentials work in blockchain applications without additional verification processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it this way:\n",
    "- **vLEI** = Your verified organizational identity\n",
    "- **Cross-Chain Identity (CCID) Framework** = The translator that makes your identity work on blockchains\n",
