    "## Importance of Key Rotation\n",
    "\n",
    "Key rotation in a scalable identity system while the identifier remains stable is the hard problem from cryptography and distributed systems that KERI solves. The need to rotate keys guided the entire design of KERI and deeply impacted the vLEI system architecture. This is because securing identity and data involves more than just signing data; robust long-term security for an identity and any data it signs relies on key rotation. The ability to rotate keys is a fundamental security practice that involves changing over time the cryptographic keys associated with an identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotating keys is not just about changing them arbitrarily; it's a crucial practice for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security Hygiene and Limiting Exposure:** Keys used frequently are more exposed to potential compromise (e.g., residing in memory). Regularly rotating to new keys limits the time window an attacker has if they manage to steal a current key\n",
    "- **Cryptographic Agility:** Cryptographic algorithms evolve. Vulnerabilities are found in older ones, and stronger new ones emerge (like post-quantum algorithms). Key rotation allows an identifier to smoothly transition to updated cryptography without changing the identifier itself\n",
    "- **Recovery and Delegation:** You might need to recover control of an identifier if the current keys are lost or compromised, or delegate authority to another entity. Both scenarios typically involve establishing new keys, which is achieved through rotation events\n"

    "## Understanding Establishment Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into key rotation, it's helpful to explain Establishment Events. Not all events recorded in a KEL are the same. Some events specifically define or change the set of cryptographic keys that are authorized to control an identifier (AID) at a particular point in time. These crucial events are called Establishment Events. The two primary types are: ¬† \n",
    "- **Inception Event (icp):** The very first event that creates the AID and establishes its initial controlling keys\n",
    "- **Rotation Event (rot):** An event that changes the controlling keys from the set established by the previous Establishment Event to a new set\n",
    "\n",
    "These Establishment Events form the backbone of an AID's security history, allowing anyone to verify which keys had control at what time. Other event types exist (like interaction events), but they rely on the authority defined by the latest Establishment Event. Interaction events rely on the signing authority of the keys referenced in the latest establishment event. "

    "## The Pre-Rotation Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "KERI utilizes a strategy called pre-rotation, which decouples the act of key rotation from the preparation for it. With pre-rotation, the cryptographic commitment (a digest of the public keys) for the next key set is embedded within the current key establishment event. This means the next keys can be generated and secured in advance, separate from the currently active operational keys. This pre-commitment acts as a safeguard, as the active private key doesn't grant an attacker the ability to perform the next rotation, as they won't have the corresponding pre-committed private key."

    "Key rotation is essential for security hygiene, cryptographic agility, and enabling recovery or delegation. KERI uses a \"pre-rotation\" strategy where the commitment (digest) for the next set of keys is included in the current key establishment event (`icp` or `rot`). This secures the rotation process even if the currently active key is compromised. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "Performing a rotation (<code>kli rotate</code>) creates a rot event, increments the sequence number, activates the previously pre-rotated keys (revealing them in the k field), and commits to a new set of keys (digest in the n field), all while keeping the AID prefix unchanged. This chained process forms part of the Key Event Log (KEL).\n",
