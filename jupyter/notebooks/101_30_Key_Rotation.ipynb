    "## Why is Key Rotation Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Securing AIDs involves more than just signing data; robust long-term management relies on key rotation. This fundamental practice involves changing the cryptographic keys associated with an identifier over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotating keys isn't just about changing them arbitrarily; it's a crucial practice for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security Hygiene & Limiting Exposure:** Keys used frequently are more exposed to potential compromise (e.g., residing in memory). Regularly rotating to new keys limits the time window an attacker has if they manage to steal a current key\n",
    "- **Cryptographic Agility:** Cryptographic algorithms evolve. Vulnerabilities are found in older ones, and stronger new ones emerge (like post-quantum algorithms). Key rotation allows an identifier to smoothly transition to updated cryptography without changing the identifier itself\n",
    "- **Recovery and Delegation:** You might need to recover control of an identifier if the current keys are lost or compromised, or delegate authority to another entity. Both scenarios typically involve establishing new keys, which is achieved through rotation events\n"

    "## Establishment Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into key rotation, it's helpful to explain Establishment Events. Not all events recorded in a KEL are the same. Some events specifically define or change the set of cryptographic keys that are authorized to control an identifier (AID) at a particular point in time. These crucial events are called Establishment Events. The two primary types are:   \n",
    "- **Inception Event (icp):** The very first event that creates the AID and establishes its initial controlling keys\n",
    "- **Rotation Event (rot):** An event that changes the controlling keys from the set established by the previous Establishment Event to a new set\n",
    "\n",
    "These Establishment Events form the backbone of an AID's security history, allowing anyone to verify who had control at what time. Other event types exist (like interaction events), but they rely on the authority defined by the latest Establishment Event."

    "## Pre-Rotation\n",
    "\n",
    "KERI utilizes a strategy called pre-rotation, which decouples the act of key rotation from the preparation for it. With pre-rotation, the cryptographic commitment (a digest of the public keys) for the next key set is embedded within the current key establishment event. This means the next keys can be generated and secured in advance, separate from the currently active operational keys. This pre-commitment acts as a safeguard, as the active private key doesn't grant an attacker the ability to perform the next rotation, as they won't have the corresponding pre-committed private key."
