    "To clearly explain the fundamentals of vLEI credentials and schemas, this notebook presents a simplified model of the credential issuance hierarchy. We will trace the flow of authority and the process of creating chained credentials using official vLEI schema definitions. For the sake of clarity, we have excluded the more advanced topics of multisignatures and delegated identifier structures, which are key components of the complete vLEI production trust chain. A practical, in-depth example of these advanced features can be found in the **[qvi-software repository](https://github.com/GLEIF-IT/qvi-software/tree/main/qvi-workflow)**"

    "Once credentials like the ones created in this chain are issued and held by their respective entities, a common next step is to present them for verification or auditing. The vLEI Audit Reporting Agent, known as Sally, is a component designed for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sally acts as a direct-mode validator. It receives presentations of vLEI credentials (like the QVI, vLEI and OOR credentials), cryptographically verifies their structure and integrity, and then performs a POST request to a pre-configured webhook URL. This allows external systems to receive trusted, real-time notifications about credential presentations and revocations within the vLEI ecosystem.\n",

    "### The Presentation Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code block performs the entire presentation flow in four main steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Establishing Contact with Sally:** Before the Legal Entity client (`leClient`) can present its credentials, it must first know how to communicate with Sally. The first action in the code is `resolveOOBI(leClient, sallyOOBI, sallyAlias)`, which resolves Sally's OOBI to establish this connection.\n",
    "2. **Running the Local Sally Service:** The code will then prompt you to start the local Sally service using a `docker compose` command. This command is critical for the demonstration:\n",
    "    - It starts a container running the Sally agent.\n",
    "    - It also starts a simple hook service that acts as the webhook endpoint, listening for and storing the reports that Sally will post.\n",
    "    - The `GEDA_PRE=${gleifPrefix}` variable passed to the command provides Sally with the Root of Trust AID for this specific notebook run. Sally requires this information to validate the entire credential chain, from the LE credential presented to it all the way back to its root anchor at GLEIF.\n",
    "3. **Presenting the Credential:** The `presentToSally()` function uses `ipexGrantCredential` to send the `leCredential` to Sally's AID. This action is the `signify-ts` equivalent of using `kli ipex grant` for credential presentation and initiates the verification process within Sally.\n",
    "4. **Verifying the Audit Report:** Finally, the `pollForCredential()` function simulates a webhook listener. Instead of running a full server, it simply polls the hook service where Sally sends its report. Upon receiving a successful `200 OK` response, it fetches and displays the JSON report, confirming that Sally received the presentation, successfully verified the trust chain, and dispatched its audit report."

    "This notebook provided a practical walkthrough of a simplified vLEI trust chain using Signify-ts, demonstrating:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><b>Hierarchical Trust:</b> Each credential in the chain cryptographically references its authorizing credential, creating a verifiable link back to the Root of Trust (GLEIF).</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Multiple Issuance Paths:</b> The vLEI ecosystem supports different issuance models, including direct issuance by a Legal Entity (for ECRs) and authorized issuance by a QVI on behalf of an LE (for OORs and ECRs).</li>\n",
    "<li><b>IPEX Protocol:</b> The Issuance and Presentation Exchange protocol facilitates the secure delivery of credentials between parties using a grant/admit message flow.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Schema Compliance:</b> Every credential adheres to a specific, SAID-identified vLEI schema, ensuring interoperability and consistent data structures.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Credential Chaining:</b> The 'edges' section of an ACDC is used to reference the SAID of a source credential, explicitly defining the chain of authority.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Audit Agent Interaction:</b> A credential holder can present their ACDC to an external agent like Sally for verification and auditing. Sally validates the entire trust chain and notifies an external service via a webhook.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "This represents a functional, albeit simplified, model of how the vLEI ecosystem issues verifiable credentials for legal entities and their roles while maintaining a robust and verifiable chain of trust.\n",
