    "## Fundamentals of Digital Signatures\n",
    "\n",
    "Having explored KERI Identifiers (AIDs) and their management, we now focus on digital signatures. This section explains what digital signatures are, their crucial properties, and how they operate within KERI.\n",
    "\n",
    "A digital signature is a cryptographic mechanism used to provide assurance about the authenticity and integrity of digital data. It serves a similar purpose to a handwritten signature but offers significantly stronger guarantees through cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The process involves two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Signing:** (see SIGNING PROCESS diagram below)\n",
    "    * The signer (e.g., an AID Controller) begins with the information they want to sign.\n",
    "    * They then create a condensed, fixed-length representation of that information ‚Äî called a digest ‚Äî by applying a hash function.\n",
    "        * A note on terminology: While the term \"hash\" is often used to refer to both the function and its output, in this text we will use ‚Äúhash function‚Äù to refer to the algorithm and ‚Äúdigest‚Äù to refer to its output.\n",
    "    * Next, the signer uses their unique private signing key to apply a digital signature algorithm to the digest. This process produces a digital signature ‚Äî a cryptographic proof that the signer authorized the original data.\n",
    "    * Only someone with access to the private key can generate a valid signature for a given digest. \n",
    "    * The generated signature is typically attached to the original information. In the case of KERI this signature is encoded in the [Composable Event Streaming Representation](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/) (CESR) encoding format.\n",

    "\n",
    "2.  **Verification:**\n",
    "    * Anyone receiving the information and signature can verify its validity using the signer's corresponding public key.\n",
    "    * The verifier applies a verification algorithm using the original information, the signature, and the corresponding public key from the correct point in history of a KEL.\n",
    "    * This algorithm is the complement of the signing process. It uses the public key to mathematically validate that the signature corresponds to the digest of the raw information. The verification algorithm applies mathematical operations (which vary by signature scheme) to confirm the signature was created with the corresponding private key for the given digest. If the mathematical verification succeeds, the signature is valid; otherwise, it fails.\n",
    "    * **Outcome:**\n",
    "        * **Valid Signature:** If the signature verification succeeds, the verifier has high confidence in the information's authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiability and can trust the data and its originator.\n",
    "        * **Invalid Signature:** If the signature fails verification the information may have been tampered with, the signature might be corrupt, or the legitimate holder of the private key didn't generate it. Thus the verifier should not trust the data.\n",
    "    * Successful verification confirms:\n",
    "        * **Authenticity:** The information originated from the owner of the key pair.\n",
    "        * **Integrity:** The information has not been altered since it was signed.\n",
    "        * **non-repudiability**: The signer cannot successfully deny signing the information. Because generating the signature requires the private key (which should be kept secret by the owner), a valid signature serves as strong evidence of the signer's action.\n",

    "## Verification Process in KERI\n",
    "\n",
    "In KERI, digital signatures are fundamental for establishing trust and verifying the authenticity of Key Events and other interactions associated with an AID. They cryptographically link actions and data back to the identifier's controlling keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the verification algorithm is standard, the key challenge for a Verifier is obtaining the correct public key(s) that were authoritative for the AID when the information was signed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Verifier must perform these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Identify the Authoritative Public Key(s):**\n",
    "    * For an AID's inception event, the AID prefix is derived from the initial public key(s) (leveraging KERI's self-certifying nature).\n",
    "    * For subsequent events (like rotations or interactions), the Verifier must consult the AID's Key Event Log to get the most up to date controlling key pair(s). The KEL provides the history of key changes, allowing the Verifier to determine which public key(s) were valid at the specific point in time the event or message was signed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Perform Cryptographic Verification:**\n",
    "    * Once the correct public key(s) are identified, the Verifier uses them, along with the received data and signature, in the standard cryptographic verification algorithm (as described earlier).\n",
    "\n",
    "This reliance on the KEL to track key state over time is crucial for maintaining the security of interactions with KERI identifiers long after their initial creation."
