# AID
Are unique, stable identifiers.
Can be created by a user's own public key.
Can also be given an alias.
Should be verified against the latest key pair for that AID.

See http://localhost:8888/lab/workspaces/auto-h/tree/101_20_Working_with_Keystores_and_AIDs_via_KLI.ipynb


We should also be able to rotate keypairs as per [here](http://localhost:8888/lab/workspaces/auto-h/tree/101_30_Key_Rotation.ipynb)

# CESR

[Composable Event Streaming Record](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/)

a Signing message digests produce a CESR

See http://localhost:8888/lab/workspaces/auto-h/tree/101_25_Signatures.ipynb

The user should be able to create their own keypairs and sign messages (see 'Signing Data' and 'Verifying a Valid Signature')
