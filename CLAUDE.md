- Tests should be self-contained and not rely on other tests
- Always pass timeout parameters explicitly in signatures with default values
- Do not use mocks or fakes. All tests should use real services
- Elysia routes should specify types like @https://github.com/aaronp/chain-as-a-service/blob/master/app/src/api/accounts.ts and use those types in the Eden client signatures
